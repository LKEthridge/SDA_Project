## *This was a Statistical Data Analysis project for TripleTen. 👩🏽‍💻*
This project analyzed fictional telecommunications company Megaline's Surf and Ultimate plans to identify which generates more revenue, using data on calls, messages, and internet usage in relation to allowances of customer plans. The findings show that Surf plan users generate higher revenue on average, primarily due to overage fees, making it the better target for marketing efforts. Regional revenue differences also emerged, suggesting further analysis to optimize the commercial budget by region.
