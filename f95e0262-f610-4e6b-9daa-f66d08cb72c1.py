# # Which one is a better plan?
# 
# You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.
# 
# You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze the clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

# <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: blue">Megaline offers two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate.  This project will determine which plan generates more revenue to help the commercial department adjust their advertising budget.  These conclusions are tentative as they reflect the data of a small data set: however, they are a starting point in determining which plan generates more revenue.</span>

# ## Prepare the data

# <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: blue">Having loaded the data, general information can be printed, fixed, and the data can be enriched as needed for each data frame.</span>

# ## Enrich data

# <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: blue">No additional factors are necessary.</span>

# ## Users

# In[5]:


# Print the general/summary information about the users' DataFrame

Call date will be converted to a date-time object for greater analysis options.  I will add a secondary column for duration that uses an integer data type as Megaline rounds call length up to the next full minute for billing purposes, so partial duration is most likely unneccessary.  However, it is prudent to maintain the data and simply create a second column: 'billed_duration'.  I will also group by user_id.

#  
# - Please note that the telecom operator rounds up all minutes and traffic values.
# 
# `Note: Megaline rounds seconds up to minutes, and megabytes to gigabytes. For calls, each individual call is rounded up: even if the call lasted just one second, it will be counted as one minute. For web traffic, individual web sessions are not rounded up. Instead, the total for the month is rounded up. If someone uses 1025 megabytes this month, they will be charged for 2 gigabytes.`

# Can you please add data rounding?

I did not do it at this stage because my understanding was this section was just for printing info and a sample to get a preview of the data and plan changes needed.

# Everything is correct here but usually, it is always helpful to double-check whether we indeed have data within one year/time period. If not then selecting and aggregating data by the month number will cause an issue. So here it is safer to use¬†datetime64[M] which provides a complete date.

# Here you need to use another way of joining tables (change the how parameter). Now, if users made calls, but did not send messages, it will not be tracked in the new table (the same with the Internet). This will happen because with the left method we take all the keys from the left table and look for their matches in the right table. If there are unique values in the right table, we will ignore them. For this task, we need to take all the records from the right and left tables.

# <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: blue">Overall, Surf plan users generate more revenue for the company: on average, 237.92 per month.  They frequently incur overage fees: the average amount of extra fees collected above their plan cost is 217.92 per month and the variance is high, suggesting that some customers incur many more fees while others incur far fewer.  On average, Ultimate plan users generate less revenue (157.80) and a smaller amount of extra fees (87.80) per month.  The variance is fairly low, so users typically stay close to the average.</span>

# - I will write overall thoughts about the data analysis section:
# - Very nice visualisation of the data. Great that you combined both plans on one graph for the comparison and also used different graph types to check available data.
# -  If you have time and willing to practice, you can display two charts (histogram and a boxplot) using a two-column subplot.
# 
# ```
#     # Create one row with 2 columns
# 	  fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 5))
# 
# 	  # Create a histogram for the surf plan
# 	  sns.distplot(... ax=axes[0])
# 	  # Create a histogram for the second plan
# 	  sns.distplot(... ax=axes[0])
# 	
# 	  # Create a boxplot for both plans
# 	  sns.boxplot(... ax=axes[1])
# ```

# - Everything is correct. Hypotheses have been formulated correctly, however, by default the alternative hypothesis states only a difference between two groups, as we don't know at this point which one is bigger or smaller. 
#     
# - Your conclusions based on the results are also correct. 
#    
# - Additionally, you can compare the variances of the samples before testing hypotheses to understand which equal_var parameter to use with the t-test_ind test method (by default, True). Here, you can manually calculate variances or use Levene's statistic test (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.levene.html) or Bartlett's test (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.bartlett.html).

# No problem at all! Glad that smth was useful.

# ## General conclusion
# <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: blue">This project set out to determine whether the Surf or the Ultimate plan earned more revenue for Megaline so that the commercial budget could be adjusted.  As noted previously, these conclusions are a starting point in determining which plan generates more revenue.</span>

# <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: blue">This project relied on several Python libraries including pandas, numpy, pyplot, factorial, and stats to analyze data from five different datasets: call data, internet usage, message data, plan information, and user information. After loading and preprocessing the data, including handling data types, fixing inconsistencies, I aggregated the information to simplify further analysis.  There was no need to enrich the data to draw the conclusions needed for this project.</span>

# <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: blue">On average, users of both plans exhibited similar call activity, with Ultimate plan users showing more variation in call duration due to their higher plan limits. However, Ultimate plan users sent only slightly more messages per month despite having a significantly higher message allowance, while some Surf plan users regularly exceeded their message limit, incurring overage fees.  Additionally, I found that Ultimate plan users generally stayed well within their internet usage limit, while Surf plan users often exceeded their data allotment, resulting in additional revenue for the company.</span>

# <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: blue">In terms of revenue, Surf plan users generate more revenue on average due to the overage fees they regularly incur.  Therefore, the advertising department should focus commercials on the Surf plan as it generates the most revenue due to these overage fees.  As for regional differences, I compared the average revenue of users in the NY-NJ area to those in other regions. The results indicated significant regional variations, suggesting the need for further analysis to determine where adjustments in the marketing budget should be made to account for these differences.</span>
